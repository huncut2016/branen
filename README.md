# Bridge Animation Engine

## Introduction

This project is motivated in helping teachers to distribute their bridge knowledge.

## How do we want to do that?
We create a tool with [manim](https://github.com/manimCommunity/manim), that can help in creating bridge visualizations.

## Issues 
  The codebase contains a lot of bugs, if you find one, please open an issue. Or if you want to make us happy, find the source of the problem and fix it.
  
## Development
  Every new stuff is in the `dev` branch. If you want to collaborate with us, do not frustrate yourself, send a pull request, we will check it, and if it is good enough, we will merge it.
  
  **If you want to be a part of our team, you need to meet these criteria:**
  - If you are Hungarian, and you can play bridge, and you know how to program, after a short meeting you are in
  - If you are not Hungarian, after 10 pull requests (medium size) (in the future it can be increased) from you, if we merge them, after a medium-long meeting, you will get in the team
